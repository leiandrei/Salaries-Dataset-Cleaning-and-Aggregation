## Salaries Dataset Cleaning and Aggregation

This Python Notebook Project showcases my skills on data cleaning, and preparation; in addition, showcasing my skills on data aggregation, and  creating pivot tables for a more robust and accurate data analysis. The following dataset was gathered from a Salary Case Study Dataset from Kaggle. (This project is still ongoing).
